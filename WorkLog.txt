DONE:
-Access twitch API
-Handle simple text commands
-Keeps track of stats by user input
-Manually add games not in twitch database
-Now playing command
-Counters as conditions instead of being functions
BUG:
-Dunno gotta do some more testing before release

TO-DO:
-??? Had ton of work and not sure what's still to do for V2 to be completed
-Port stats from current file to new format
-(minor) Match counter mostly for mtg
-??? Announce that a stat has recently modified to acknoledge user input

IDEAS:
-Handle text command in a way that can be edited without changing the code (text file?)
-Once we get the bot on the clouds have an live page displaying stats for every games
-Once we get the bot on the clouds have an live page displaying log for relevant entries
